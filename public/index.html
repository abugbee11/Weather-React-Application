<!-- I unfortunately got hit with COVID and somehow seem to have lost my original React File on CodeSandbox, so I am SLOWLY starting to rebuild my weather app so that it matches. This is just the basic framework. Icons are not using API yet, the functions/search isn't working or connected to API, etc. Please bear with me, but I wanted to show that I can at least upload to GitHub and Netlify-->
